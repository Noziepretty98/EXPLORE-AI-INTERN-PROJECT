# Synthetic Segmentation Training Data Generator

## Project Overview

In this project, we developed a model to generate high-quality synthetic datasets for segmentation tasks. The scarcity and high cost of labeled training data for segmentation are common challenges in computer vision applications. To address this, we leveraged Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create realistic synthetic images, helping reduce the reliance on costly and hard-to-obtain real-world data.

## Problem Statement

Obtaining large, high-quality labeled datasets for training segmentation models is both challenging and expensive. This project aims to bridge this gap by using synthetic data generation methods, producing high-quality, realistic artificial images that can be used in segmentation tasks.

## Project Goals

1. **Generate Synthetic Training Data**: Create realistic images that can be used to train segmentation models effectively.
2. **Optimize Image Quality**: Use a GAN-based model to produce synthetic images that closely resemble real data in terms of detail and features.
3. **Reduce Data Collection Costs**: By generating synthetic data, we aim to cut down the costs associated with traditional data collection and labeling.

## Methodology

The project primarily leverages a **Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CondGAN)** to generate synthetic images with high segmentation accuracy. Here’s a breakdown of the key components:

- **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**: A GAN is an architecture that includes a **generator** and a **discriminator** working in tandem.
  - **Generator**: Produces synthetic images based on input conditions (such as segmentation maps or other contextual inputs).
  - **Discriminator**: Evaluates the quality of the generated images, helping refine them to look more realistic.
  
- **Conditional GAN (CondGAN)**: We used a conditional GAN architecture, allowing the generator to create specific image types based on conditional inputs. This makes it particularly useful for segmentation tasks, where we want distinct regions to represent specific classes.

### Technical Details

- **Data**: The model is trained on [describe the type of data you used, if available, e.g., satellite images, medical images].
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: Implemented using TensorFlow and PyTorch, with OpenCV for image preprocessing.
- **Architecture**: Utilized a U-Net model for segmentation tasks and a GAN model with a discriminator to enhance image quality.
- **Automation**: We set up an automated pipeline using Apache Airflow to streamline the data generation and model training process.

### Results

The GAN model was able to:
1. **Produce realistic synthetic images**: The generated images successfully mimic the characteristics of real data, making them viable for segmentation training.
2. **Improve segmentation model accuracy**: Initial experiments indicate that using the synthetic data for training segmentation models resulted in [describe any accuracy metrics, if available].
